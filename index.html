                    I wanted him to return me to the way I was before! I was the perfect warrior! Cold and ruthless! I lived by my strength alone,
                    uninhibited by foolish emotion! But slowly...over the years...I became one of you, my quest for greatness
                    gradually giving way
                    to this life of mediocrity. I awoke one day to find that I had settled down, formed a family...I had even
                    grown quite
                    fond of them. Would you believe, I almost started to think the Earth was a nice place to live...? Do you
                    understand now,

                    these petty
                    attachments...and I'd have to say, it feels pretty good."</p>
